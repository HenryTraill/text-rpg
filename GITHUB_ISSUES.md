## Implementation Notes

### Issue Labeling System
- **Phase Labels**: `phase-0`, `phase-1`, `phase-2`, `phase-3`, `phase-4`
- **Component Labels**: `api`, `database`, `frontend`, `websocket`, `infrastructure`
- **Feature Labels**: `combat`, `social`, `economy`, `character`, `world`, `guild`
- **Priority Labels**: `high`, `medium`, `low`
- **Type Labels**: `enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`, `testing`

### Dependencies
Many issues have dependencies that should be tracked:
- Authentication (Issue #5) blocks most other API features
- Database schema (Issue #2) blocks all data-dependent features
- WebSocket setup (Issue #4) blocks real-time features
- Basic combat (Issue #10) blocks advanced combat features
- Guild system (Issue #11) blocks territory control (Issue #19)

### Estimation Guidelines
- Infrastructure issues: 1-2 weeks each
- Core API endpoints: 3-5 days each
- Complex features (raids, territories): 2-3 weeks each
- Polish and optimization: 1-2 weeks each
- Testing and documentation: 20% of development time

This breakdown provides 31 detailed GitHub issues that cover the complete development of the medieval text MMO RPG, from initial infrastructure setup through final polish and scaling.
