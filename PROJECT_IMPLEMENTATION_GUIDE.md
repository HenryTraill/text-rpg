## Implementation Strategy

### Sprint Planning Recommendations
- **Sprint Length**: 2-3 weeks
- **Epic 1**: 2 sprints (infrastructure foundation)
- **Epic 2**: 4-6 sprints (core game features)
- **Epic 3**: 4-5 sprints (social features)
- **Epic 4**: 5-6 sprints (advanced features)
- **Epic 5**: 3-4 sprints (polish and scale)

### Team Structure Recommendations
- **Backend Developer(s)**: API development, database design
- **Frontend Developer**: React UI/UX implementation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring
- **Game Designer**: Balance, content creation, analytics
- **QA Engineer**: Testing, quality assurance

### Parallel Development Opportunities
1. **Frontend + Backend**: Can work in parallel after API design
2. **Infrastructure + Core Features**: DevOps can prepare deployment while core features develop
3. **Content + Features**: Game designer can create content while features are being built
4. **Testing + Development**: QA can create test frameworks while features develop

## Technical Stack Reference

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI with SQLModel ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+
- **Cache/PubSub**: Redis 6+
- **Background Tasks**: Celery
- **Real-time**: WebSocket with Redis pub/sub

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux or Zustand
- **Styling**: CSS Modules or Styled Components
- **Build Tool**: Vite or Create React App

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (production)
- **Monitoring**: APM solution (DataDog, New Relic)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for frontend, Python type hints for backend
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ for critical paths
- **Code Review**: All changes require review
- **Linting**: ESLint for frontend, Black/Flake8 for backend

### Performance Targets
- **API Response Time**: <100ms (95th percentile)
- **WebSocket Latency**: <500ms for real-time updates
- **Concurrent Users**: 1000+ supported
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute per user
- **Encryption**: HTTPS/WSS for all communications
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization
- **Security Audits**: Regular penetration testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Real-time Scaling**: Address with Redis clustering and WebSocket pooling
2. **Database Performance**: Implement read replicas and query optimization
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular audits and automated scanning
4. **Data Loss**: Multiple backup strategies and verification

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined epics and phases
2. **Timeline Delays**: Regular sprint reviews and adjustments
